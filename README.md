# MORT

MORT is a MOtorized RoboT with a tank chassis, powered by bare-metal C on the ATMega328P processor
aboard the Arduino Nano. MORT is controlled remotely via an IR remote, uses turn signals and
reverse lights to indicate his actions, and senses walls so that it does not run into them.

This project is my effort to bring a professional approach to the design and implementation
process, and an excuse to expose myself to concepts such as CI/CD, professional Git and GitHub
usage, project documentation and PCB design.
